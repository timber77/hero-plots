This is a loose collection of scripts and code used during my Master Thesis for creating plots and analyzing the measurement results  

The plots.ipynb is the current main file used to create the plots  

The main.py is outdated and was used in the beginning before moving to a notebook


the app folder contains helper functions for analyzing the data and also continas the functions to create the plots

the accuracy_check folder was used to test the accuracy by running multiple inferences on the FPGA. 

the images folder is an output folder where some plots are saved

the measurements contains the measurement data$

metadata contains some additional data on resnet operation used for generating the plots

the insn_trace.py was a script once used to map an instructiontrace from the vivado trace to the snitch instruction by mapping the addresses to the corresponding instruction based on a dump of the binary
